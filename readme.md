# Porygon, Map Editor
The base of this project is a stripped down base of my other level editor framework project.

**!! Executable jar is not working at the moment, needs better configuration !!**

#### Requirements:

* JDK 1.8+
* Any Java IDE that has Maven support

#### Build/dependancy tool:

**Maven** is one of the build and dependancy managements tools in Java.
It can be compared to NuGet for C# but allows for build configurations
in addition to dependancy management.

It is bundled with IntelliJ so you don't have to download it yourself!
